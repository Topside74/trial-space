The leadership came from prominent Islamic families and socially respected elders of the community. The Masjid Dars officially began in 1923 . It was later transformed into an Islamic Academy in2015.  it attained the prestigious affiliation with Darul Huda Islamic University, becoming one of its recognized institutions.

        <h4>Abdul Salam Quasimi</h4>
        <p>I praise my Lord for blessing me with the opportunity to serve at Al-Hidaya.
           I take pride in the managing committee of Njalakam Jama'ath for affiliating this institution with Darul Huda and operating it in a context that is relevant to the times.
           The right path is the goal of both Darul Huda and Al-Hidaya. It is the right path that Allah has revealed in the Qur'an (Al-Baqara).
           If, because of you, a single person is guided to the right path, it is better for you than the whole world and everything in it. (Hadith)
           There is no doubt that this institution is creating milestones of transformation within the Muslim community.
           I hope that the leaders of tomorrow will be the children of this institution. With the humble request that your prayers and support be with all the endeavors the institution puts forward…
